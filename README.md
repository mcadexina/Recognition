## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris_recognition.git
   cd iris_recognition
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### Training the CNN Model

To train the iris recognition CNN model:

```
python train_iris_model.py
```

This will:
- Load the iris dataset from the `dataset` directory
- Preprocess images (grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization)
- Train a CNN model with data augmentation
- Save the trained model to `iris_cnn_model.h5`

### Testing the Model

To evaluate the model performance:

```
python test.py
```

Select option 2 to evaluate the model on your dataset.

### Generating Synthetic Data

The system includes a feature to generate synthetic iris data for testing:

```
python test.py
```

Select option 1 to generate synthetic iris data.

### Running the Web Interface

To launch the web application:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open a web interface where you can:
- Upload grayscale or color iris images
- Choose between different feature extraction methods
- See preprocessing steps and feature visualizations
- Compare different iris images
- Access debugging information about the model
